# TDD--Case-Study

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the code that needs to be tested. This approach ensures that the codebase is always in a testable state, encourages simple designs, and instills confidence in code quality. In this case study, we will explore TDD in Java through the development of a simple method to validate user names. We will follow the TDD cycle to implement and test the ‘isValidUserName’ method in a class called App.
